## Overview
Successfully enhanced the `5-Cleanup.ps1` script to include comprehensive Power Platform component cleanup, including custom connectors and Copilot Studio agents.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Cleanup Functions Added

#### `Remove-PowerPlatformCustomConnectors`
- **Purpose**: Discovers and removes custom connectors from Power Platform environments
- **Features**:
  - Lists all connectors using Power Apps REST API
  - Filters for custom connectors (Premium/Standard tier, petstore, custom names)
  - Provides detailed confirmation prompts for each connector
  - Tracks successful operations and errors
  - Handles API errors gracefully

#### `Remove-CopilotStudioAgents`

```

### With Environment Variable Override
```powershell
$env:POWER_PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT_NAME = "YourEnvironmentName"
