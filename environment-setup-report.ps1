.SYNOPSIS
Power Platform Environment Setup - Consolidated Manual Steps Documentation

.DESCRIPTION
This script documents the successful completion of Power Platform environment setup
including both automated and manual steps that were required.

PROCESS SUMMARY:
===============

‚úÖ COMPLETED AUTOMATED STEPS:
1. Power Platform environment created via REST API
2. Environment variables configured in .env file
3. Regional placement aligned with Azure infrastructure
4. Base environment permissions established

üõ†Ô∏è  COMPLETED MANUAL STEPS:
1. Dataverse database provisioned via admin portal
2. Managed Environment features enabled
3. Enterprise governance policies applied

This script serves as documentation and verification of the complete setup.
